    <h1>Boiled Chicken</h1>

    <p class="faded">The ultimate neutral good food. Makes 3-4 meals and the broth is great for soups</p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Get whole chicken<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Wash the packaging<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Put it in a big pot<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Open it<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Take out the ziploc from the butt.<span class="faded"> Usually they put organs there, maybe not. It should say on the package if that's the case. I'm not sure yet if you can cook with these or if they're safe to eat. Might depend on where the chicken is made.</span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Bring to boil.<span class="faded"> A lid can speed up the process</span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Scoop out the gunk<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Cover and simmer.<span class="faded"> Use the lowest heat you have. Check on it in 5 min to see if it's bubbling. If not increase it a bit. Be careful of overboiling if the water is close to the top.</span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Use tongs to rip out pieces onto cutting board.<span class="faded"> It's done if it pulls out easily and the bones fall of the meat.</span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Separate meat from bones<span class="faded"></span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Store the meat.<span class="faded"> You can eat it plain later, or slightly fry it in some infused oil. Last time I fried some tomatoes garlic and rosemary in a pan with lots of olive oil and cooked the chicken in the oil for 2-3 min and it was great. The oil adds some moisture that the boiled chicken lacks.</span></p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Store the broth or boil veggies in it.</p>
