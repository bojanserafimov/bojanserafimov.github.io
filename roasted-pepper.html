      <h1>Roasted Pepper</h1>
      <p>
          Thick red peppers are great for roasting. They're great raw too but
          roasting brings out a new flavor (and smell) which makes the pepper
          usable in different contexts.
      </p>

      > Buy thick red peppers.
      <span class="faded">
        Thin or green peppers are not that great for roasting. At least I don't
        like them. The green ones get watery and gross. Red bell peppers work
        great.
      </span><br><br>

      > Preheat to 400
      <span class="faded">
        and make sure the oven rack is in the middle.
      </span><br><br>

      > Cut long slits on 3 different sides.
      <span class="faded">
        We do this so they don't pop and splatter when heated.
        <span style="color: #fa0;">IMPORTANT: Don't add oil or salt!</span>
        It's no big deal if you do, but it will only make peeling harder later on.
      </span><br><br>

      > Arrange on baking sheet.
      <span class="faded">
        Be mindful of how much empty space there is on the sheet. It will
        affect how hot the bottom gets and how much cooking time you need.
        The thickness and number of peppers might affect cooking time too.
      </span><br><br>

      <div class="line"><h3><span>Bake</span></h3></div>

      > Bake 20-30 min
      <span class="faded">
        They should be deflated and blackened
      </span><br><br>

      > Flip and bake again for the same duration.
      <span class="faded">
        Raw peppers are tasty, roasted peppers are tasty, but underroasted
        peppers are watery and have a different smell. Be patient, let them roast.
      </span><br><br>

      > Let them cool in a closed container.
      <span class="faded">
        Plastic bag works too. I don't know why but it makes them easier to peel.
      </span><br><br>

      > Peel.
      <span class="faded">
        If you did everything right it should be pretty easy.
