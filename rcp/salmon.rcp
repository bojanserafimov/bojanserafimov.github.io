# Salmon

Just cook it like a steak in the cast iron. Maybe will take longer but you can look at it and take temp easily. It should be 145 internal, an it should end up opaque and easily separable. If it sticks to the pan, give it some time or jiggle it out with the metal thingy. Maybe also make some cuts so it doesn't fold up.
