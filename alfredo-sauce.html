        <p class="faded">
          Easy white pasta sauce. Works well on rice too.
        </p>

        > Get saucepan<br>

        > Add 1 stick of butter<br>

        > Add 1 cup of heavy cream.
        <span class="faded">If you don't have it, use 1 cup of milk and
          1 tbsp of flour</span><br>

        > Add 1 cup shredded parmesan.
        <span class="faded">Any kind of parmesan works, but shredding a block
        yourself might work better than using the pre-shredded kind. The latter
        has stuff in it to prevent it from sticking to itself, so it will retain
        some grainy texture, which you might not like.</span><br>

        > Heat on low until butter melts
        <span class="faded">Keep stirring to prevent burning. Whisk well to
        combine everything. Cook at least 20 min if you used flour.</span><br>
