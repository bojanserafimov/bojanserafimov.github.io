        <h1>Egg Fried Rice (content warning: sacrilege)</h1>
        <p>
          I followed another white boy's recipe and turned my boiled
          rice leftovers into a full delicious meal in 10 minutes.
          there's a lot to improve here, but it's good enough to make again.

          You want something that handles heat (some non-stick pans don't)
          and is roomy enough to allow you to stir the rice. There are many
          variations on fried rice, but most traditional ones will use a wok.
          Not sure if you'll get all the benefit of a work if you don't also
          have a wok stove, wok burner, and mad wok skills. Use what you know.
          I used a cast iron skillet. It was deep enough to allow me to move
          the rice around without spilling, but it took a while to heat up.

          <div class="faded">
          You'll need to scoop rice, stir it, and break up any chunks. I used
          a spatula, and it was fine but rice clumps were hard to break. I've
          seen people use the back of a ladle.

          Prep all the ingredients. You won't have time to do this while cooking.

          It's important for the rice to be cold. I don't know why yet.

          <span style="color: #fa0;">IMPORTANT:</span> Don't use olive oil, it will burn and give you cancer.
          </div>
          > Add cooking oil and sesame oil to the rice<br>

          <div class="faded">
          We cook the eggs before the rice so we can get the moisture out of them.

          > Heat a good amount of high-temperature oil<br>

          <div class="faded">
          Now the goal is to mix everything as fast as possible, keep rice grains
          separated, and then toast them at very high heat which will release a
          new smell and flavor
          </div>
          > Add the rice<br>
          > Break up any chunks<br>
          > Turn the heat to high<br>
          > Add a drop of soy sauce and mix it <span class="faded"> (it should sizzle)</span><br>
          > Cook until rice gets toasted. Stir<br>
          > turn off the heat<br>
          <br>
          <div class="faded">
          We leave these for the end because we don't want to burn them, and
          they don't have much moisture so we don't have to cook them first.
