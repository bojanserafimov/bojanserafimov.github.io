        <h1>About The Cookbook</h1>
        <p>
          I wanted to learn how to cook stuff beyond just boiled eggs.
          So I googled "beginner recipes" and only found recipes that:<br>
          - take hours to make<br>
          - require washing 5 dishes<br>
          - use special ingredients<br>
          - skip the basics of why things work<br>
          - induce anxiety<br>
          - are unreadable because of ads<br>
          - are paywalled<br>
          - contain irrelevant stories and fluff<br>
          - are hard to sight-read while cooking<br>
          <br>
          A bit much for beginners, wouldn't you agree? I also found it suspicious
          that no list of "beginner recipes" starts with "here's how to boil eggs".
          So I decided to document my learning process and maybe come back to it
          later and write a comperhensive "complete cooking guide for millenials".
          The goal is not to give you the trendiest recipes so that you can try
          impress your father-in-law, but to help you:<br>
          - take ownership of the kitchen<br>
          - build the habit of cooking every day<br>
          - understand the basic ingredients, techniques, tools<br>
          - focus on recipes that are worth the effort<br>
          - have an alternative to ordering disappointing food<br>
          - write your own recipes<br>
          <br>
          But first I need to learn this stuff myself.<br>
