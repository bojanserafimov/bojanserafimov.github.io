        <h1>Egg Fried Rice (content warning: sacrilege)</h1>
        <p>
          I followed another white boy's recipe and turned my boiled
          rice leftovers into a full delicious meal in 10 minutes.
          there's a lot to improve here, but it's good enough to make again.
        </p>

            <details><summary>Get pan that handles heat, maybe a wok? I don't
                know if it would be useful without the special wok stovetop and
                special burner. I used a cast iron skillet. It was fine because
                it fit all my rice and I didn't spill much while stirring, but
                it's not ideal since it takes long to respond to heat.
