        <h1>Fried Rice (content warning: sacrilege)</h1>
        <p>
          Frying leftover rice is a great way to get a delicious meal in 10 minutes.
          There are many different eastern ways of doing this, but here I'm trying
          to find what works in a western kitchen.

          We won't have time to look for things while cooking fried rice.
          It's important to prep everything in advance.

          > Get dark soy sauce.
          <span class="faded">
            All soy sauce looks dark, but "dark soy sauce" is a separate thing.
            I've been told that "Lee Kum Kee" is a good brand. Other brands
            (maybe Japanese ones?) might have a different definition of dark..
            or something else idk really. Tl;dr: get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Dark-Sauce-16-9oz-Pack/dp/B09NCSG1QP">this</a>
            from amazon.

          > Get the right pan.
          <span class="faded">
          You want something that handles heat (some non-stick pans don't)
          and is roomy enough to allow you to stir the rice. There are many
          variations on fried rice, but most traditional ones will use a wok.
          Not sure if you'll get all the benefit of a work if you don't also
          have a wok stove, wok burner, and mad wok skills. Use what you know.
          I used a cast iron skillet. It was deep enough to allow me to move
          the rice around without spilling, but it took a while to heat up.
          Maybe a stainless steel skillet could work too.

          > Get a tool for stirring.
          <span class="faded">
          You'll need to scoop rice, stir it, and break up any chunks. A spatula
          works well for me.

            <span style="color: #fa0;">IMPORTANT: Don't use olive oil!</span>
            It will burn and give you cancer. Use vegetable oil or canola oil.
            Something with a high smoke point.

          It's important for the rice to be cold. I don't know why yet.

            The goal is to cook the wet stuff first so we don't have excess moisture
            in the rice, then cook the rice on high heat until it gets toasted, and
            finally add low-moisture ingredients.
