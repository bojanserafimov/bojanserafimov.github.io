        <h1>Mashed Potato</h1>
        <p class="faded">
          If you just boil potatoes, mash them, add mik, butter, salt, you'll
          end up with some version of mashed potatoes. Depending on method
          it will be smooth or chunky. This method is for a smooth result.

        > Wash and cut out any bad spots.
        <span class="faded">Don't bother peeling. It's a waste of time.</span><br><br>

        > Cut to 1 inch fries.
        <span class="faded">We're just trying to minimize the distance to
          the center so that they'd cook faster, without having to spend a lot
          of time cutting. So don't worry about precise measurement, just make
          them equal.</span><br><br>

        > Boil until they're soft.
        <span class="faded">Use a fork to test doneness. It should slide
          right through.</span><br><br>

        > Pass them through a ricer.
        <span class="faded">The ricer is a quick way to equally mash all the pieces,
          which will create a smooth texture. The ricer also separates the skins, and
          you can decide if you want to leave them in or not. I usually leave them in
          for nutritional value, but might take them out if I think they'll distract
          from the creamyness. An alternative to the ricer could be to use a mixer,
          but it's a pain to wash. Or maybe hand mashing with a fork or potato masher
          will give you a chunkier result, which you might like.</span><br><br>

        > Add butter to taste.
        <span class="faded">Add it while potatoes are warm. I like to add
          butter until its flavor starts being noticeable. It ends up being about
          half a stick per person.</span><br><br>

        > Add milk to taste.
        <span class="faded">Adding milk changes the texture, from creamy to runny.
          I like it almost runny.</span><br><br>

        > Add salt to taste.
