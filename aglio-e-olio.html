        <h1>Aglio e Olio (content warning: sacrilege)</h1>
        <p>
          Very simple in theory but steep learning curve in practice. I've made
          it 2 times so far. Second time was better but still could be improved.
          These are my notes.
        </p>

        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
        <div class="line"><h3><span>Shopping</span></h3></div>

        > Extra virgin olive oil. <span class="faded">I use <a href="https://pompeian.com/product/robust-extra-virgin-olive-oil/">this one</a></span><br><br>

        > Spaghettoni. <span class="faded">This recipe doesn't use many strong flavors, so the
          flavor of the actual pasta comes out. If you want to try a fancier pasta, this would
          be a good recipe to use it with. Find my recommendations <a href="wip.html">here</a></span><br><br>

        > Garlic. <span class="faded">See storage tips <a href="garlic.html">here</a></span><br><br>

        > Red chili pepper. <span class="faded">You can sub this with dried red
          pepper flakes, but it's better not to. All the other ingredients will
          make the sauce sticky and oily, and the pepper is needed to balance it
          out with some zing and pep. Using a real pepper is worthwhile.</span><br>

        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
        <div class="line"><h3><span>Prep</span></h3></div>

        > Start boiling water. <span class="faded">Usually you'd boil a deep pot of water, but not for this.
          We'll be using the water, and if there's too much water it won't be starchy enough to create
          a thick sauce. So find a wide and shallow skillet. Fill it up just enough to fit the pasta once it
          softens.</span><br><br>

        > Cut parsley. <span class="faded">Use a good amount, maybe 10 stems. Separate stems from leaves.
          Keep the stems whole because we'll want to remove them from the sauce. Chop the leaves to a size
          smaller than the noodle thickness. Use a sharp knife and a slicing motion so you don't crush
          them.</span><br><br>

        > Cut pepper. <span class="faded">Cut to tiny pieces, same as the parsley. Maybe don't use the seeds.
          </span><br><br>

        > Chop 4 cloves of galic. <span class="faded">Either smash them, or dice them very tiny, or mix and
          match. If you smash, the garlic will take a bit longer to cook, but it will taste softer. You'll also
          be able to remove it from the sacue. Instead if you dice it will cook in 30 sec, and will remain in
          the sauce and make it more sticky.</span><br><br>

        > Heat oil on low. <span class="faded">Use a tall skillet or a pot because we'll be stirring pasta
          in this later. Use a burner next to the other skillet because we'll be transferring pasta over.
          Use enough oil to coat the bottom. Oil will make up a third of our final sauce by volume.</span><br>

        <div style="clear: both;"></div>
        <div class="line"><h3><span>Cook</span></h3></div>

        > Salt the water. <span class="faded">Keep in mind that more than half of the water will probably
          be unused, so salt more than you'd think. But you can also salt a bit after cooking, so it's safer
          to undersalt.</span><br><br>

        > Add pasta when water boils. <span class="faded">It won't fit in the skillet straight, but it
          will bend eventually. Use tongs to move it a bit so it doesn't stick to itself. But don't move
          it too much out of place. We'll want to take it out using tongs at the end, and it would be
          nice to grab all the noodles in one scoop right at the middle.</span><br>
