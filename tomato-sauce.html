      <h1>Tomato Sauce</h2>
      <p>
          The goal is to extract the best flavors of fresh onion and garlic
          into the olive oil and mix that with high quality tomatoes which
          will dominate the flavor. All measurements are negotiable.

        <span class="faded">
            The best ones I've
          found are San Marzano D.O.P. You can buy many different kinds and
          taste them. They differ in water content, acidity, taste, texture.
          The San Marzano D.O.P. ones that I get are in a thick sauce that
          tastes like tomato juice, and are the least acidic out of all the
          ones I tried. You can also use fresh tomatoes but the imported canned
          tomatoes have more consistent quality.
        </span><br>
        > herbs
        <span class="faded">
            It's nice to have fresh basil or thyme. If not dried is fine. Bay
            leaf is nice to have too.
        </span><br>

            <span class="faded">
            This way we can easily and quickly pour it to take heat off the garlic
            later without making a mess. Use a ladle to move the tomatoes. The back
            of the ladle is also useful for breaking up the tomatoes in the pyrex
            to speed up their cooking later.
        </span><br>
          > Add the garlic when the onions are soft.<span class="faded">
            Taste it to see if it's soft. Don't rush. We don't want a crunchy sauce.
        </span><br>
          > Add the tomatoes when the garlic has
        cooked for 30-60 sec and started to smell nice.
        <span class="faded">
          It's possible to overcook garlic. It will taste bitter.

        <span class="faded">
            Garlic gets sticky, don't let it dry.
        </span><br>
        > Occasionally stir, taste, season
        <span class="faded">
            (with salt, pepper, herbs)
        </span><br>
        > Simmer until it reduces.
        <span class="faded">
            It can take anywhere between 30min and 2 hours. Also the more it
            simmers the less sour it gets.
        </span><br>
        > Add tomato paste.
        <span class="faded">
          Adding paste thinckens the sauce and adds flavor. But if you add
          it too early (before tomatoes have fallen apart and onions have
          completely melted) you'll have trouble simmering. Larger bubbles
          will form and pop, which will make a mess on your stove.
        </span><br>
        > If it's still sour, maybe add sugar.
        <span class="faded">
            But if you used good tomatoes it probably won't be.

        <span class="faded">
            If you have any extra, put it in jars while it's still hot,
            and store them in the fridge when they cool. Freezing also
            works but some flavor is lost.
