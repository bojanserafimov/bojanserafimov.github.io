    <h1>Roast</h1>

    <p class="faded">Braising works great with fatty meats (which are also cheaper) by turning collagen to gellatin or something like that, I don't know. Takes a while to cook, but it's versatile and stores well.</p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Get chuck roast.<span class="faded"> Beef with lots of fat is good for braising (slow cooking)</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Get dutch oven.<span class="faded"> A dish that can go in the oven, can hold liquid, has a lid.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Lightly sear on both sides.<span class="faded"> Just for flavor. U can skip this</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Remove meat, fry other things.<span class="faded"> I just do tomato paste. Also optional</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add water.<span class="faded"> Just to dissolve the stuff from the bottom</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Put the meat back in<span class="faded"></span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add carrots and potatoes.<span class="faded"> Also optional, but this makes it a full meal.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add more water to cover everything<span class="faded"></span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Put lid on<span class="faded"></span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Bake on 300 for at least 3h.<span class="faded"> Cooking more won't hurt it. But remember the lid! Without a lid water will escape and things will burn.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Season as you eat.<span class="faded"> I recommend salt over the potatoes, maybe pepper too.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Store leftovers.<span class="faded"> The liquid is good too, as a beef broth substitute.</span></p>
