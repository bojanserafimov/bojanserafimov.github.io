    <h1>Lentils</h1>

    <p class="faded">Macedonian recipe for green lentil soup.</p>

    <p style="clear: both">> Cook aromatics.<span class="faded"> Same as the <a href="tomato-sauce.html">tomato sauce</a>
     recipe.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add some tomato paste with the garlic.<span class="faded"> Traditionally you'd use tomatoes, or canned tomatoes, but it's not worth opening a can to use 4 big spoons only.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Measure and wash lentils.<span class="faded"> Use a strainer. 1 cup of dry lentils is 4 portions. You should overshoot because it stores well for leftovers.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add water.<span class="faded"> See package for quantity)</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add lentils<span class="faded"></span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Season.<span class="faded"> > Granulated chicken bouillon and dried vegetables spice</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Simmer covered for 1 hour<span class="faded"></span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Add half a spoon of flour.<span class="faded"> Maybe mix it in warm water first</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Eat with fresh italian bread.<span class="faded"> It's a macedonian recipe, but the italian bread you'd find in the bakery section of a supermarket is the kind of bread we eat. It's a boring kind of white soft bread.</span></p>
    <p style="clear: both">> Save leftovers.<span class="faded"> It's better the next day!</span></p>
